1. Start.

2. Set the duration for green light = 50 seconds.
   Set the duration for yellow light = 20 seconds.
   Calculate the duration for red light as red = green + yellow = 50 + 20 = 70 seconds.

3. Check car sensors:
   a. If the number of cars waiting at the red light is greater than or equal to 5:
      - Trigger the system to reduce red light duration to 10 seconds.
   b. Else, no action is required, and the system will continue to run with the calculated red light duration.

4. Check pedestrian walk light:
   a. If the pedestrian presses the button and the current state is red:
      - Decrease the red light waiting period by 10 seconds.
      - Note: Ensure that no other state is active when reducing the red light duration.
   b. Else, no action is required, and the system will continue to work according to the current state.

5. Check if both pedestrain walk light & car sensors are active,
   a. it will reduce the time upto 10 secs.
   b. else, no action is required and system will continue to work according to current state.

6. End.
